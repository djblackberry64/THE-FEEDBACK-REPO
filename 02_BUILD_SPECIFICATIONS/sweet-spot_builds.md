# Sweet spot builds for different Framework models

## Framework 16

### 7040 Series – The "Goldilocks" Build (€2900 approx.)

You can find the specific configuration under this link. Beware that this is the configuration with standard black spacers and the numpad. <a href="https://frame.work/at/de/share-my-laptop?token=8684224f61a">Link to configuration</a><br />
To add the m.2 dual adapter that provides extra storage options when installing it in the standard expnasionbay shell with the graphical interposer (both included in the config because the config contains both the graphics module and the expansion bay shell) visit this link: <a href="https://frame.work/at/de/products/dual-m-2-adapter">Link to M.2 dual adapter</a>

#### Brief summary and reasoning

With this configuration and the added extras you get a solid, future proof framework 16 build with excellent modularity. You can add more storage without more hassle with the functioning m.2 adapter powered expansion bay shell with the graphical interposer, you can have modular graphics for more demanding workflows with the graphics module, you get a system that's easily repairable and upgradeable like with any framework and you get multiple options (with or without numpad, with or without extra graphics) as well as enough expansion cards to start your journey with Framework.
