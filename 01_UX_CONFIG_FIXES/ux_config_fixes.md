# UX and Config fix suggestions

## Website configurator

The website configurator should have full CRUD functionality to further improve User experience.
An example approach could be adding the full CRUD functionality to the configurator (as well as a delete option and overview in the shopping cart, I overlooked that the things in the shopping cart are already implemented). The configuration of the very thing that's in the shopping cart shouldn't be implemented due to risks of misconfigurations right before buying could arise from that. An important thing to note is that a deleted config shouldn't result in a deleted item in the shopping cart and vice versa as it currently does.
