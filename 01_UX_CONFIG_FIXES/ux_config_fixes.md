# UX and Config fix suggestions

## Website configurator

The website configurator should have full CRUD functionality to further improve User experience.
An example approach could be adding the full CRUD functionality to the configurator as well as a delete option and overview in the shopping cart. The configuration of the very thing that's in the shopping cart would be handled by just linking to the configuration. An important thing to note is that a deleted config shouldn't result in a deleted item in the shopping cart and vice versa.
